## sql-challenge
In this project, six tables were created to hold the data from CSV files, and the CSV files were imported into a SQL database. After creating tables, data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis were performed, respectively.

#### data modeling
For data modeling, an Entity Relationship Diagram of the tables was created by using QuickDBD.

#### data engineering
For data engineering, data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints were speicified, and six CSV files were imported into its corresponding SQL tables in the correct order to handle the foreign keys.
